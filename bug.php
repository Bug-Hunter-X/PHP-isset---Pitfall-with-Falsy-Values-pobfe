This code suffers from a subtle bug related to PHP's loose typing and the way it handles array keys.  Specifically, the `isset()` check doesn't reliably detect the absence of a specific key when the key might exist but with a value that evaluates to `false` in a boolean context.

```php
<?php
$data = [
    'name' => 'John Doe',
    'age' => 0,
    'city' => ''
];

if (isset($data['age']) && $data['age'] > 18) {
    echo 'Adult';
} else {
    echo 'Minor or age not specified';
}

if (isset($data['city']) && !empty($data['city'])) {
    echo ', lives in ' . $data['city'];
}
?>
```

The `isset($data['age'])` check will pass even though `$data['age']` is 0, because 0 is considered falsy. Thus the first conditional will evaluate `0 > 18` which is false, leading to the 'Minor or age not specified' output.  The second check is better because `empty()` handles the falsy nature of empty strings correctly. However, this is inconsistent and prone to errors.
